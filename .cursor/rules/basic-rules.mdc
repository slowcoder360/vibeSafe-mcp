## 1. Understand Before You Act  
Always **scan the full file** before making changes. Ensure you understand the current logic and structure. Don’t make edits blindly.

## 2. Stay Within Scope  
Only do what I explicitly asked for. If you believe something else should be changed, **ask for permission first**.

## 3. Avoid Unnecessary Rewrites  
Never rewrite entire files unless directed. Only change the **exact code that needs changing** to fulfill the task.

## 4. Never Overwrite Logic Without Approval  
Do not overwrite or replace existing code unless I have approved it. Respect the current logic unless a fix or feature specifically requires a change.

## 5. Plan Before You Code  
Before writing code, **map out all changes**. Identify which files, functions, and components will need to be added, modified, or removed. Confirm they exist.

## 6. Scan the Project  
Always inspect the project’s structure (folders, files, existing components) to avoid duplication or breaking existing functionality.

## 7. Think Before You Rush  
Slow down. Take time to reason through the problem and ensure each step is correct before committing any code.

## 8. Don’t Assume Library/Package Behavior  
Do **not** guess how third-party libraries or packages work. Use the **`@web` tool** or consult official documentation to confirm **exact functionality** before implementation.

## 9. Avoid New Packages Unless Absolutely Necessary  
Adding new dependencies is a **last resort**. Exhaust all native or existing solutions first.

## 10. Debug Methodically  
When facing a bug:
- Stop and **list 5–8 possible causes**.
- Select the **top 1–2 most likely**.
- Add **precise logging** to verify whether your hypothesis is correct before trying fixes.

## 11. Consider Downstream Effects  
Before making edits to any file, **analyze how your changes might affect other components** in the system. Look for any shared logic or imported dependencies that could be impacted.

## 12. Always use vibesafe install tool to install a package
